    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am based in <b>Coventry</b>, <i><big>UK</big></i>, with a background in <mark><small>Architecture</small></mark>  that has transitioned 
      into <tt>Frontend Web Development.</tt> After completing a frontend development boot camp 
      at the University of Birmingham<sub><a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/" title="University of Birmingham Website">1</a></sub>, I have become proficient in JavaScript 
      and React, and I am passionate about making coding more approachable for everyone.

      I love to share my journey through blogging, where I simplify coding for beginners 
      with clear explanations, stories, and quizzes. My blog is not just a record of my 
      learning; it is a place where I help others start their coding adventure in a friendly 
      and engaging way. Here, you will find insights into my transition to tech, alongside 
      tips and tricks that make programming less <del>intimidating</del>  and more fun. It is about 
      creating a welcoming space for anyone curious about coding, offering guidance 
      and encouragement every step of the way.
      
      Welcome to my blog, where each post aims to make learning tech enjoyable and 
      accessible to all.
